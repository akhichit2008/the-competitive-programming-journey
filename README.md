# ðŸ“š A Competitive Programming Journey - Intro

## Introduction

As a school student I was always fascinated by how computers work. So, one day I stumbled across the python programming language. I learned more about it and found that it was apparently something that can be used to make apps and games. I didn't anything knew other uses of python back then. But after a year of learning programming I now know how powerful and useful knowing to code can be.

A few months ago I learned C++ and found it really interesting as it gave me more control over my programs. I mastered the basics of C++. Then recently I found out about IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics). It is a prestigious computer programming olympiad. I decided to give it a try. But, to even take part in IOI training camp for my country I must top the two qualifier rounds which is not as easy as it sounds.

So, a few days back I started preparing for the first Indian qualifiers which will probably be held during November and December of every year. In this gitbook I will be logging my progress, notes and achievements while preparing for the upcoming IOI and it's qualifier rounds.



## What is the use of this book ?

In this website I will also explain about various algorithm and data structure concepts that one must master to excel in the IOI. I will explain each concept step by step with examples and illustrations. Practice problems will be present at the end of each concept. This website will serve as a resource for learning and mastering important concepts of competitive programming required for participating in various programming and computing olympiads.
